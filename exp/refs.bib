  title={srcdiff: Syntactic differencing to support software maintenance and evolution},
  author={Decker, Michael John},
  year={2017},
  school={Kent State University}
}

"Abstract—An efficient and scalable rule-based syntactic-differencing
approach is presented.  The tool, srcDiff, is built upon the srcML
infrastructure.  srcML adds abstract syntactic information into the
code via an XML format.  A syntactic difference of srcML documents is
then taken.  During this process the differences are further refined
using a set of rules that model typical editing patterns of source
code by developers.  Thus, the resulting deltas models edits that are
programmer centric versus a purely syntactic tree edit view.  Other
syntactic differencing approaches focus on obtaining an optimal
tree-edit distance with the assumption that this will produce an
accurate difference.  While this may work well for small or simple
changes, the differences quickly become unreadable for more complex
changes.  By contrast, the approach presented here, purposely deviates
from an optimal tree-difference in order to create a delta that is
both easier to understand and better models changes between the
original and modified.  To evaluate the approach, a comparison user
study against a state-of-the-art syntactic differencing approach and
two line-based differencing tools is conducted as an online
within-participant study with about 70 subjects on fourteen sample
changes.  The results provide support that the rule-based
syntactic-differencing produces more accurate and understandable
deltas."
