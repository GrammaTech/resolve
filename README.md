## Abstract
Resolve implements multi-lingual semantic differencing of software
source code and implements an automated technique of merge conflict
resolution on top of merge conflicts over the resulting differences.

## Tools
- command-line AST differencing
- web-based AST differencing
- test-suite guided merge conflict resolution

## Language Support
- JavaScript via ESTree ASTs (w/acorn)
- C/C++ via Clang ASTs
- Java via JavaParser ASTs
- Common-Lisp via Eclector
