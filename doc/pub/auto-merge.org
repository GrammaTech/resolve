#+Title: Automated Merge Conflict Resolution

Potential paper.

Contributions:
- A novel semantic merge strategy made possible by the increased use
  of CI and increased programmatic availability of test suites
  (c.f. semantics [16,17] and hybrid [2,18,19])
- Empirical results of AST-level differences.
  - How many conflicts may be avoided. (c.f. syntax [9-15])
- Empirical study of merge conflicts in C/C++ and JavaScript
- Empirical study of merge conflicts in non-primary language files.
  Most importantly build and test infrastructure (cf. test see [22,23]).
  These are necessary when using the test suite as objective function.
