# A wrapper script for ast-diff to allow its invocation by as a git
# external diff tool.  Git will pass 7 arguments to this tool,
#
#     old-file old-hex old-mode new-file new-hex new-mode
#
# where as ast-diff only wants the second and fifth arguments.
#
# To configure git to use ast-diff run the following in a repository:
#
#     git config diff.external /full/path/to/resolve/bin/git-ast-diff
#
# or run the following to configure its use globally.
#
#     git config --global diff.external /full/path/to/resolve/bin/git-ast-diff
#
ast-diff "$2" "$5"
