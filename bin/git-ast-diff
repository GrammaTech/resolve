# A wrapper script for ast-diff to allow its invocation by as a git
# external diff tool.  Git will pass 7 arguments to this tool,
#
#     old-file old-hex old-mode new-file new-hex new-mode
#
# where as ast-diff only wants the second and fifth arguments.
#
# To configure git to use ast-diff run the following in a repository:
#
#     git config diff.external /full/path/to/resolve/bin/git-ast-diff
#
# or run the following to configure its use globally.
#
#     git config --global diff.external /full/path/to/resolve/bin/git-ast-diff
#
# If you have configured this script as your git-diff driver, and it
# starts to act buggy, you can disable it for individual runs by
# passing the --no-ext-diff option to git-diff.
#
# NOTE: Define the environment variable GIT_AST_DIFF_DEBUG to a file
# name to collect debug output into that file.  Unset that variable to
# avoid collecting debug output.

## With debugging.
