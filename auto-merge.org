* Plan
1. Finish collecting conflicts from our JavaScript projects.
2. Focus on polishing this tool =ast-diff= for JavaScript first.
3. Build a (private) Web REST-API for the differencing and merging.
4. Build in the ability to collect some analytics.
5. Read about minimum users before we move to the marketplace.
   (Figure out if maybe we should try the marketplace as another)
6. Build a web front end with some analytics.

** Product Council <2019-04-03 Wed>
- Focus on JavaScript first.  It avoids the complication of having to
  use compilation databases, worry about flags, etc...
- GitHub's Market place could be a good place to
  - Get some validation that it is working reliably
  - Build a user community
- It might be that we could share this with Mozilla (Vineeth has
  contacts) if we want people to try out the JavaScript.
- Pay for this under Bug-Injector
- MVPs
  1. ast-diff (REST Web access with front end.)
  2. ast-merge
  3. github
