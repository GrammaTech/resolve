* Plan
1. Finish collecting conflicts from our JavaScript projects.
2. Focus on polishing this tool =ast-diff= for JavaScript first.
3. Build a (private) Web REST-API for the differencing and merging.
4. Build in the ability to collect some analytics.
5. Read about minimum users before we move to the marketplace.
   (Figure out if maybe we should try the marketplace as another)
6. Build a web front end with some analytics.

* Competitors
There are unused research prototypes and there are very simple
commercial tools.  There are no tools like this in the GitHub
marketplace that returns against searches for "merge" or "diff."

The most sophisticated commercial tool named "semantic merge" (note:
semantic merge has a distinct meaning in the research community and
that is not what this tool does).  Semantic merge is developed by a
version control company (plastic VC).  It looks to target MS Windows
and doesn't support JavaScript.  I think it is in another section of
the market.

* Tasks [0/1]
** TODO Finish the JavaScript experiment using ast-merge
* Notes and Ideas
* Meetings
** Product Council <2019-04-03 Wed>
- Focus on JavaScript first.  It avoids the complication of having to
  use compilation databases, worry about flags, etc...
- GitHub's Market place could be a good place to
  - Get some validation that it is working reliably
  - Build a user community
- It might be that we could share this with Mozilla (Vineeth has
  contacts) if we want people to try out the JavaScript.
- Pay for this under Bug-Injector
- MVPs
  1. ast-diff (REST Web access with front end.)
  2. ast-merge
  3. github

- Potential customers
  - Github could incorporate our tools as a distinguishing feature.
    E.g., our automated merge conflict resolution.  There is a
    spectrum here from the Marketplace up to incorporation into an
    existing dominant Marketplace service all the way up to
    incorporation into GitHub itself.
  - Development shops.  Large development companies are rolling many
    similar tools themselves.  Perhaps they would purchase them from
    us instead.

- We should start dogfooding these tools as soon as they're
  sufficiently mature.

- Potential customers (thinking e.g. GitHub here but also applies to
  development shops) will be facing a "Buy or Build" question.  We
  should have good arguments in this respect... what distinguishes our
  tools?  What is the value we bring?
  - time to market
  - our total investment KLOC
  - monies and expertise which we have applied

- Need to collect a table of potential *show stoppers* along the
  following lines.
